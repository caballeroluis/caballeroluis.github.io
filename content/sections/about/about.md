I have a strong background in software development, with a particular focus on front-end development. My journey began with vocational training. Since then, I have gained valuable experience through various roles, contributing to different projects in various industries.

I started by obtaining a vocational training certificate as a Technician in Microcomputer Systems and Networks, where I solidified my computer knowledge. Subsequently, I continued my studies, completing a vocational training program as a Higher Technician in Web Application Development, which provided me with a solid foundation in development and programming.
